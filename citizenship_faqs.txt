Other sources include newspapers, employment portals, and official government websites.

Check Eligibility – Every government job has specific eligibility criteria regarding age, education, and nationality. Carefully read the job notification to ensure you meet all the requirements.

Register on the Official Website – Most government job applications are submitted online through official portals like SSC (ssc.nic.in), UPSC (upsc.gov.in), or RRB (rrbcdg.gov.in). You may need to create an account and fill in personal and educational details.

Fill Out the Application Form – After registering, carefully complete the online form with accurate details. Upload required documents such as educational certificates, caste certificates (if applicable), and photographs.

Pay the Application Fee – Some exams require a small application fee, which can be paid online using debit/credit cards or net banking. Certain categories like SC/ST and female candidates may be exempt from fees.

Download Admit Card – Once the application is accepted, an admit card will be released before the exam date. Download it from the official website and check the details carefully.

1. How can a Bank Passbook be used as an ID proof?
A Bank Passbook is a financial document issued by banks to account holders, containing transaction history and personal details. It is widely accepted as identity proof in various government and private services.

Where can a Bank Passbook be used as ID proof?
Government Services – A passbook with a photograph can be used for Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, and other registrations.

Educational Institutions – Some universities accept it as proof for admissions.

Address Verification – It serves as address proof for utility connections, ration cards, and driving licenses.

Banking & Financial Transactions – Some institutions require ID proof for high-value transactions, and a passbook is considered valid.

Conditions for Acceptability:
It must include the account holder’s name, address, photograph, and bank’s official seal.

Some government offices require a self-attested photocopy of the passbook.

2. What banks provide passbooks with photos?
Several Indian banks issue passbooks that include a passport-size photo of the account holder. This makes them more widely accepted as ID proof.

Banks that commonly provide photo passbooks:
State Bank of India (SBI)

Punjab National Bank (PNB)

Bank of Baroda (BoB)

Canara Bank

Union Bank of India

Indian Bank

HDFC Bank (for certain account types)

ICICI Bank (upon request)

Many private sector banks prefer digital statements over passbooks, but government banks still issue physical passbooks with photos for account holders. If your bank does not provide a passbook with a photo, you can request an updated passbook with an image by visiting the bank.

3. Can I use my digital passbook as an ID proof?
A digital passbook or bank statement is generally not accepted as valid identity proof. This is because:

Digital statements can be altered or edited, making them less reliable for ID verification.

Most government agencies require physically stamped and signed documents for authentication.

Exceptions where digital passbooks may be used:
Online KYC verification – Some financial institutions accept digitally signed statements.

E-Governance Portals – For services like e-filing of income tax or digital Aadhaar updates, digital passbooks may work.

Banks & Loan Applications – Some banks accept e-passbooks or PDF statements sent directly from the bank’s email.

For official purposes, it’s always better to use a physical passbook with a bank seal and signature.

4. What happens if my passbook is lost?
Losing a bank passbook can be inconvenient, especially if it contains important transaction history or is used as identity proof.

Steps to replace a lost passbook:
Report the loss to the bank – Inform the nearest branch about the missing passbook.

Request a duplicate passbook – Fill out a duplicate passbook request form.

Submit an ID proof – Provide Aadhaar, PAN, or any other valid identity document.

Pay the nominal fee – Banks charge around ₹100–₹500 for reissuing a new passbook.

Collect the new passbook – After processing, the bank will issue a new one with the latest transaction updates.

Precautions:
If your lost passbook contained a photograph, request the bank to include your photo in the new one.

Always keep a scanned copy of the passbook to avoid future issues.

5. How to update personal details in a Bank Passbook?
If your name, address, or contact details change, you must update them in your bank records. The passbook will reflect these changes after they are approved.

Steps to update details in a Bank Passbook:
Visit the bank branch – Updates cannot be done online; physical presence is required.

Fill out the application form – Request a ‘Change of Personal Details’ form.

Submit supporting documents –

For Name Change: Marriage certificate, Gazette notification, or Aadhaar/PAN update proof.
